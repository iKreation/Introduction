Understand

**1. Our first priority is to be a profitable, honorable, successful business.**

We can do nothing else listed here if our business does not remain open and does not operate with integrity. We define success based on the other things listed here.

**2. Our second priority is to do our very best to ensure every customer, both paying and non-paying, is satisfied each time they have an experience with our business**

Even a horrible experience can become a memorable one if handled with care.

**3. It is your privilege** 

And responsibility to make our jobs easier by lightening the load, taking the initiative, challenging our ideas when appropriate, and enhancing our team’s culture.

**4. It is our privilege**

And responsibility to extract every ounce of potential from you that we can, to make you the best contributor to our team and to our community that you can possibly be.

**5. Do what works best for you and for our company, not others.** 

You would be unwise to not consider the methods, tools, and ideas of others. However, you would be even more unwise to be swayed by every new compelling or forceful argument that comes along merely because it was spoken by someone notable.

**6. When uncertain about a decision, contemplate it further and counsel with the team.**

I have found that the best decisions I’ve made have followed significant thought and discussion, rather than hastily making a decision.

**7. There will be times when you will be required to use your best judgment and ask for forgiveness later if necessary.*

Don’t let fear of reprehension prevent you from accomplishing great things or from resolving problems when time is of the essence.

**8. Good judgment begets great judgment.** 

As you consistently make good decisions, you’ll find your propensity for making good decisions in the future increases. Mistakes, and learning from mistakes, are indispensable tools for acquiring wisdom and improving judgment. Making the right decision the first time, however, is exponentially more beneficial to our company and to your overall well-being.
